## Description

You can use the flow log function to monitor the IP traffic information for an ENI, a VSwitch or a VPC. If you create a flow log for a VSwitch or a VPC, all the Elastic Network Interfaces, including the newly created Elastic Network Interfaces, are monitored. Such flow log data is stored in Log Service, where you can view and analyze IP traffic information. It is recommended that VPC Flow Logs be enabled for packet "rejects" for VPCs.

## Remediation

1. Logon to [VPC console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/).
2. In the left-side navigation pane, click `FlowLog`.
3. Follow the instruction to create `FlowLog` for each of your VPCs.

### Default Value:

By default, Flow Logs is not enabled when you create a new VPC.
