## Description

RAM password policies can temporarily block logon after several incorrect logon attempts within an hour. It is recommended that the password policy is set to temporarily block logon after 5 incorrect logon attempts within an hour.

## Remediation

### Using the management console:

1. Logon to [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/overview).
2. Choose `Settings`.
3. In the `Password` section, click `Modify`.
4. In the `Max Attempts` field, check the box next to `Enable` and enter `5` in the field.
5. Click `OK`.

### Using the CLI:

aliyun ram SetPasswordPolicy --MaxLoginAttempts 5
```

### Default Value:

The default password policy does not define Max Attempts.
