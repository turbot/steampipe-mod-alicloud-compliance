## Description

A network policy is a specification of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. NetworkPolicy resources use labels to select pods and define rules which specify what traffic is allowed to the selected pods. The Kubernetes Network Policy API allows the cluster administrator to specify what pods are allowed to communicate with each other.

## Remediation

Only the Terway network plugin support the Network Policy feature, so please make sure not choose Flannel as network plugin when creating cluster.

### Using the management console:

1. Logon to [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/k8s/cluster/list).
2. Click the `Create Kubernetes Cluster` button and select `Terway` in `Network Plugin` option.

### Default Value:

By default, Network Policy is disabled when you create a new cluster, and you should choose the Terway as the cluster network plugin when creating the cluster.
