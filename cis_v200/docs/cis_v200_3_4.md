## Description

Once a VPC peering connection is established, routing tables must be updated to establish any connections between the peered VPCs. These routes can be as specific as desired, even peering a VPC to only a single host on the other side of the connection.

## Remediation

1. Logon to [VPC console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/).
2. Open the `Routing Table`.
3. Remove and add `route table entries` to ensure that `the least number of subnets or hosts` as is required to accomplish the purpose for peering are routable.

### Default Value:

Routing table is empty by default upon creation for any newly created routing table, hence it denies any default access.
