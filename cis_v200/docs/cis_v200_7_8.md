## Description

Alibaba Cloud ENI (Elastic Network Interface) has supported assign ranges of internal IP addresses as aliases to a single virtual machine's ENI network interfaces. This is useful if you have lots of services running on a VM and you want to assign each service a different IP address without quota limitation.

## Remediation

Only the Terway network plugin support the Network Policy feature, so please make sure not choose Flannel as network plugin when creating cluster.

### From Console

1. Logon to [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/k8s/cluster/list).
2. Click the `Create Kubernetes Cluster` button and select `Terway` in `Network Plugin` option.

### Default Value:

By default, ENI multiple IP mode is not supported in Flannel network plugin which is the default plugin when creating the cluster, and you should choose the Terway as the cluster network plugin when creating the cluster.
