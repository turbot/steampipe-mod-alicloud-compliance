## Description

OSS Bucket Access Logging generates a log that contains access records for each request made to your OSS bucket. An access log record contains details about the request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and date the request was processed. It is recommended that bucket access logging be enabled on the OSS bucket.
