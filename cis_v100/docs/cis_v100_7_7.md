## Description

A network policy is a specification of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. NetworkPolicy resources use labels to select pods and define rules which specify what traffic is allowed to the selected pods. The Kubernetes Network Policy API allows the cluster administrator to specify what pods are allowed to communicate with each other.

## Remediation

Only the Terway network plugin support the Network Policy feature, so please make sure not choose Flannel as network plugin when creating cluster.

### From Console
