## Description

Alibaba Cloud ENI (Elastic Network Interface) has supported assign ranges of internal IP addresses as aliases to a single virtual machine's ENI network interfaces. This is useful if you have lots of services running on a VM and you want to assign each service a different IP address without quota limitation.

## Remediation

Only the Terway network plugin support the Network Policy feature, so please make sure not choose Flannel as network plugin when creating cluster.

### From Console

1. Logon to [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/k8s/cluster/list).
2. Click the `Create Kubernetes Cluster` button and select `Terway` in `Network Plugin` option.
