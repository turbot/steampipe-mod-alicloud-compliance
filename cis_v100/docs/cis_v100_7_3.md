## Description

In Kubernetes, authorizers interact by granting a permission if any authorizer grants the permission. The legacy authorizer in Kubernetes Engine grants broad, statically defined permissions. To ensure that RBAC limits permissions correctly, you must disable the legacy authorizer. RBAC has significant security advantages, can help you ensure that users only have access to specific cluster resources within their own namespace and is now stable in Kubernetes.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Logon to [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/k8s/authorize).
2. Select the target RAM sub-account and configure the RBAC roles on specific clusters or namespaces.
