## Description

The monitoring service in Kubernetes Engine clusters depends on the Alibaba Cloud CloudMonitor agent to access additional system resources and application services in virtual machine instances. The monitor can access metrics about CPU utilization, some disk traffic metrics, network traffic, and disk IO information, which help to monitor signals and build operations in your Kubernetes Engine clusters.
