## Description:
Once a VPC peering connection is established, routing tables must be updated to establish any connections between the peered VPCs. These routes can be as specific as desired, even peering a VPC to only a single host on the other side of the connection.

## Remediation:

### From Console:

1. Logon to [VPC console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/).
2. Open the `routing table`.
3. `Remove` and `add` route table entries to ensure that the least number of subnets or hosts as is required to accomplish the purpose for peering are routable.
