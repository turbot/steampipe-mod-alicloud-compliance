## Description

The flow log can be used to capture the traffic of an Elastic Network Interface (ENI), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or Virtual Switch (VSwitch). The flow log of a VPC or VSwitch shall be integrated with Log Service to capture the traffic of all ENIs in the VPC or VSwtich including the ENIs created after the flow log function is enabled. The traffic data captured by flow logs is stored in Log Service for real-time monitoring and analysis. A capture window is about 10 minutes, during which the traffic data is aggregated and then released to flow log record.
