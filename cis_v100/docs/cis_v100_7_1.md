## Description

Log Service is a complete real-time data logging service on Alibaba Cloud to support collection, shipping, search, storage and analysis for logs. It includes a user interface to call the Log Viewer and an API to management logs pragmatically. Log Service could automatically collect, process, and store your container and audit logs in a dedicated, persistent datastore. Container logs are collected from your containers. Audit logs are collected from the kube-apiserver or the deployed ingress. Events are logs about activity in the cluster, such as the deleting of Pods or Secrets.
