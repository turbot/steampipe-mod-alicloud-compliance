## Description

A private cluster is a cluster that makes your master inaccessible from the public internet. In a private cluster, nodes do not have public IP addresses, so your workloads run in an environment that is isolated from the internet. Nodes have addresses only in the private address space. Nodes and masters communicate with each other privately using VPC peering.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Logon to [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/k8s/cluster/list).
2. Click the `Create Kubernetes Cluster` button and make sure `Public Access` is `not enabled`.
