# Alibaba Cloud Compliance Mod

Run individual configuration, compliance and security controls or full compliance benchmarks for `CIS` and across all your Alibaba Cloud accounts.

## References

[Alibaba Cloud](https://alibabacloud.com) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

[CIS Alibaba Cloud Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/alibaba_cloud/) provide a predefined set of compliance and security best-practice checks for Alibaba Cloud accounts.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.
